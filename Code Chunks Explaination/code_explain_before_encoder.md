`preprocess_sentence(file_name):`
    This function reads a file and preprocesses the text. The function adds <start> and <end> as tags at the beginning and end of each sequence respectively, and returns the preprocessed text.

`calculate_max_length(tensor):`
    This function calculates the maximum length of a tensor and returns it.

`tokenize(text):`
    This function tokenizes the input text into numeric sequences with a maximum length, using a tokenizer object from the `tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer` class. It takes a list of strings as input and converts them to sequences of integers. It also pads each sequence to the maximum length of the vector and returns a tokenizer object, the tokenized vector, and the max_length.

The three functions are used for preprocessing the input data to prepare it for training a sequence-to-sequence model for punctuation prediction.



This code prepares the input and output data for the sequence-to-sequence model training by calling the `preprocess_sentence()` and `tokenize()` functions.

1. First, it reads the text data from two files (input_pun.txt and output_pun.txt) using the `preprocess_sentence()` function. This function reads the file, adds <start> and <end> tags to the beginning and end of each sequence, and returns the preprocessed text.

1. Next, the `tokenize()` function is called with the preprocessed input and output text as inputs. This function converts the text into numeric sequences using the Tokenizer class from the `tf.keras.preprocessing.text` module. It also pads the sequences to the maximum length using `pad_sequences()` function from `tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence` module. The Tokenizer object is returned, along with the tokenized vectors and the maximum length of the padded sequences.

2. Finally, the tokenized input and output data along with their corresponding tokenizer and maximum length are stored in `input_tensor, input_tokenizer, input_max_length, target_tensor, target_tokenizer, target_max_length` variables for later use in the sequence-to-sequence model training.



This code defines a function called convert that takes in a tokenizer object and a tensor of indices, and prints the mapping of indices to words using the tokenizer object.
It then applies the convert function to the first element of `input_tensor, target_tensor` to print the index-to-word mappings for the input and output languages.

The output of this code block will display the index-to-word mappings for the first sequence in the input and output tensors.
This can be useful for understanding how the preprocessing step has transformed the raw text into sequences of integers that can be processed by the model.



This code sets up the hyperparameters for the model training and creates a training dataset using the input and target tensors. Here is what each line does:

`BUFFER_SIZE = len(input_tensor)` : sets the buffer size for shuffling the dataset to be the length of the input tensor.
`BATCH_SIZE = 256` : sets the batch size for training.
`steps_per_epoch = len(input_tensor) // BATCH_SIZE` : calculates the number of steps per epoch based on the length of the input tensor and the batch size.

`embedding_dim = 128` : sets the size of the embedding layer.
`units = 1024` : sets the number of units in the LSTM layer.

`vocab_inp_size = len(input_tokenizer.word_index) + 1` : calculates the size of the input vocabulary.
`vocab_tar_size = len(target_tokenizer.word_index) + 1` : calculates the size of the target vocabulary.

`train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((input_tensor, target_tensor)).shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE)` : creates a TensorFlow dataset from the input and target tensors, shuffles the data using the buffer size, and slices it into batches.

`train_dataset = train_dataset.batch(BATCH_SIZE, drop_remainder=True)` : batches the data using the batch size and drops any remaining examples that do not fit into a full batch.

`example_input_batch, example_target_batch = next(iter(train_dataset))` : retrieves an example batch from the dataset.
`example_input_batch.shape, example_target_batch.shape`: prints the shapes of the input and target batches.
