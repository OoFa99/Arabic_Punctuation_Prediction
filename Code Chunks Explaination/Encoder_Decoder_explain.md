This code defines a class called `Encoder` which inherits from the `tf.keras.Model` class. This allows us to define our own model with specific layers and functionality that we require.

The `Encoder` class takes in the following arguments during initialization:

- `vocab_size`: the size of the vocabulary for the input language
- `embedding_dim`: the dimension of the embedding space for the input language
- `enc_units`: the number of units in the GRU layer of the encoder
- `batch_sz`: the batch size for the input data

The `__init__` method defines the architecture of the `Encoder` model. The `embedding` layer is created using the `Embedding` class from Keras, which creates a lookup table for the input words and maps them to an embedding vector of size `embedding_dim`. The `gru` layer is created using the `GRU` class from Keras, which is a type of recurrent neural network layer.

The `call` method of the `Encoder` class takes in two inputs: `x` and `hidden`. `x` is the input to the `Encoder` model, and `hidden` is the initial state of the GRU layer. The `embedding` layer is applied to the input `x` to map each word in the input sequence to its corresponding embedding vector. The output and state of the GRU layer are then computed using the `gru` layer and returned.

The `initialize_hidden_state` method initializes the hidden state of the GRU layer to a tensor of zeros with shape `(batch_sz, enc_units)`.

Overall, this `Encoder` class defines the architecture and functionality of the encoder in a sequence-to-sequence model.





This code defines a custom attention layer called BahdanauAttention, which is used in the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model. The attention mechanism allows the decoder to selectively focus on different parts of the encoder output during decoding.

The layer takes the following inputs:

- `query`: The hidden state of the decoder GRU at a given time step (i.e., the decoder's "query" vector).
- `values`: The encoder output tensor, which has shape `(batch_size, max_length, hidden_size)`.

The layer first applies two dense layers, `W1` and `W2`, to `values` and `query` respectively, and then adds the two results together with a `tanh` activation. The result is then passed through another dense layer `V` to produce a score tensor of shape `(batch_size, max_length, 1)`. The `tanh` activation and `Add` operation help capture the "compatibility" between the decoder hidden state and the encoder output at each position.

Next, the score tensor is normalized with a softmax activation along the `max_length` axis, resulting in a tensor of attention weights of shape `(batch_size, max_length, 1)`. The attention weights represent how much the decoder should focus on each position of the encoder output.

Finally, the attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the encoder output, resulting in a context vector of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`. The context vector is then returned, along with the attention weights. The `Multiply`, `reduce_sum`, and `Permute` layers are used to perform the weighting and summation operations.





This code defines a `Decoder` class that inherits from `tf.keras.Model`. The `Decoder` class implements the decoder component of the sequence-to-sequence model, which generates the target sequence from the context vector and previous target sequence.

The `Decoder` class has several attributes:

- `batch_sz`: the batch size of the input data
- `dec_units`: the number of hidden units in the decoder
- `embedding`: an embedding layer that converts the input token indices into dense vectors
- `gru`: a GRU layer that takes the input embeddings and hidden state as input and produces output and new hidden state as output
- `fc`: a fully connected layer that produces the logits for each target token
- `attention`: an instance of the `BahdanauAttention` class, which is used to compute attention weights and context vectors.

The `call` method of the `Decoder` class takes three inputs:

- `x`: the current target token
- `hidden`: the current decoder hidden state
- `enc_output`: the encoder output, which is used to compute attention weights and context vectors

The `call` method performs the following steps:

1. Compute the context vector and attention weights by passing the hidden state and encoder output to the attention layer.
2. Compute the embedding of the current target token.
3. Concatenate the context vector and target token embedding along the last dimension.
4. Pass the concatenated vector to the GRU layer, producing output and new hidden state.
5. Reshape the output tensor to have shape `(batch_size, dec_units)`.
6. Pass the reshaped output through the fully connected layer to produce logits for the next target token.
7. Return the logits, the new hidden state, and the attention weights.

The decoder takes the context vector and previous target tokens as input and produces the logits for the next target token in the sequence. The attention mechanism allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each step, improving the model's ability to generate accurate output sequences.



# Calling the Mentioned Functions #

1. `encoder = Encoder(vocab_inp_size, embedding_dim, units, BATCH_SIZE)` creates an instance of the `Encoder` class with the following parameters:
   - `vocab_inp_size`: the size of the input vocabulary.

   - `units`: the number of units in the GRU layer.
   - `BATCH_SIZE`: the size of the training batch.
2. `sample_hidden = encoder.initialize_hidden_state()` initializes the hidden state of the encoder with zeros.
3. `sample_output, sample_hidden = encoder(example_input_batch, sample_hidden)` passes an example input batch through the encoder and returns the encoder output and final hidden state.
4. `attention_layer = BahdanauAttention(10)` creates an instance of the `BahdanauAttention` class with `10` units.
5. `attention_result, attention_weights = attention_layer(sample_hidden, sample_output)` applies the attention mechanism to the encoder output and hidden state, returning the attention result and attention weights.
6. `decoder = Decoder(vocab_tar_size, embedding_dim, units, BATCH_SIZE)` creates an instance of the `Decoder` class with the following parameters:
   - `vocab_tar_size`: the size of the target vocabulary.
   - `embedding_dim`: the dimensionality of the embedding space.
   - `units`: the number of units in the GRU layer.
   - `BATCH_SIZE`: the size of the training batch.
7. `sample_decoder_output, _, _ = decoder(tf.random.uniform((BATCH_SIZE, 1)), sample_hidden, sample_output)` passes a random tensor of shape `(BATCH_SIZE, 1)` through the decoder along with the encoder output and final hidden state to obtain the decoder output, which in this case is `sample_decoder_output`.



# Optimizer and Loss function #

- The `optimizer` variable is defined using the Adam optimization algorithm. This will be used to optimize the model's parameters during training.
- The `loss_object` variable is defined using Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy loss. This is a common loss function used for multi-class classification problems, and it will be used to calculate the model's loss during training.
- The `loss_function` is a custom loss function that calculates the loss for a given `real` and `pred` sequence of tokens. It does this by creating a boolean mask to ignore padding tokens, applying the mask to the loss, and then calculating the mean loss over all non-padding tokens.
- The `checkpoint_dir` variable defines the directory where the checkpoint files will be saved during training.
- The `checkpoint_prefix` variable defines the prefix for the checkpoint files.
- The `checkpoint` object is created using the `tf.train.Checkpoint()` function, and it is used to save the optimizer, encoder, and decoder variables during training.
